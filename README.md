# Data Analytics: Space-missions-project

The space missions project is the exercise 98 (Day 98) proposed by the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021</a> and taught by Dr Angela Yu. It is an exercise with no solutions provided to the student on which I was the first to submit a finished version since the course launched.

The complete code has been organized visually in the following <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LgG0qQJcgVFcL0FGPRC6kgRBEPoDNxE7?usp=sharing">notebook</a>. A static jupyter-notebook is also provided inside the repository, but it loses the interactivity. Also, a couple of the Plotly's plots get weirdly rendered when removing the interactivity. Thus, I strongly advise to check out the google colab notebook.

The goal is to do a thorough analysis of the space race, which started in 1957 and continues up to date. The main takeaway from this exercise is how to create amazing interactive plots with very detailed information using Plotly.

**Remark 1**. This is a re-upload from my old GitHub account. Therefore, if you take a look at the commits, they have been pushed the same day. Nonetheless, I tried to recreate how the commits occurred when I created this project the first time (from 2020-12-10 to 2020-12-20).
